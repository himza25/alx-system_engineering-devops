## Description
This repository is for practicing with regular expressions using Ruby's Oniguruma library. The exercises include different tasks that test various aspects of regular expressions, from basic string matching to advanced log parsing.

## Tasks

### 0. Simply Matching School
This task requires writing a Ruby script that accepts an argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method to find the string "School".

- File: `2-repetition_token_1.rb`

### 3. Repetition Token #2
Yet another repetition token task but with its own set of rules.
- File: `3-repetition_token_2.rb`

### 4. Repetition Token #3
This task requires finding a regular expression that matches given conditions but without using square brackets in the regular expression.
- File: `4-repetition_token_3.rb`
