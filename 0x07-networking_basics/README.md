# Networking Basics #0

This project contains scripts that cover basic networking concepts. The tasks involve understanding and demonstrating foundational networking concepts such as the OSI model, different types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, and the difference between TCP and UDP.

## Tasks

### 0. OSI model
A script that answers questions related to the OSI model, specifically about its definition and how it's organized.

### 1. Types of network
This script identifies the type of network described in various scenarios â€“ local (LAN), wide-area (WAN), or the internet.

### 2. MAC and IP address
A simple text response to questions concerning what a MAC address and an IP address are, clarifying their unique identifiers in a network.

### 3. UDP and TCP
This script is an explanatory text for TCP and UDP boxes, explaining the characteristics of each protocol.

### 4. TCP and UDP ports
A Bash script that displays listening ports, showing the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

### 5. Is the host on the network
A Bash script that uses the ping command to check network connectivity to a given IP address.
